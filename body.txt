All without locking you into a proprietary file format

.txt

Won't ever email you

Won't deprecate your favorite feature

Won't be acquired by creeps

Won't try to pivot into a social network

Won't ask you to update your operating system

Won't hold your data hostage

Will just save the things you type into your computer

So you have them
